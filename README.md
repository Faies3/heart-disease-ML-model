### This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning models. We performed data analysis, visualization, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and model evaluation using multiple metrics.###
- Key Highlights

✔ Tested multiple models (KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
✔ Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance
✔ Cross-validation to ensure model robustness
✔ Used all key metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
✔ Detailed data analysis with visualizations
